Amazon Dataset Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) Project
Project Overview
This project aims to conduct an exploratory data analysis (EDA) on an Amazon dataset using Python and various data analytics libraries. The goal is to delve into the dataset, uncover patterns, derive insights, and present findings through visualizations and summary statistics.

Key Objectives
Analyze the Dataset:
Understand the structure, features, and distributions of the data.
Identify Trends and Anomalies:
Find trends, correlations, and anomalies within the dataset.
Communicate Insights:
Use descriptive statistics and visualizations to effectively communicate insights.
Formulate Hypotheses:
Develop hypotheses or questions for further analysis based on initial findings.
Present EDA Report:
Provide a comprehensive EDA report outlining key observations and recommendations.
